# BouncingDiamonds


The intent of our game is to keep the diamond in the air by bouncing it off of the platform

The main mechanic in this game is translating mouse input to position the platform in order to keep the diamond in the air. Additionally, we use physics and collisions to determine when the diamond collides with the platform or walls

We used a picture of a diamond to represent the diamond

The main joys we experienced were when the scoring system functioned properly and when we fixed all of the collision issues
The main struggles we experienced were getting the score to update properly and fixing the hitboxes of the platform and diamond
